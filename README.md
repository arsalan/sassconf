# SassConf 2013 Demo's

These demo's were created by [Roy Tomeij](http://roytomeij.com) ([@roy](http://twitter.com/roy)) for a workshop at SassConf 2013 in NYC.

## Installation

Clone this repo and do `bundle install` if you're using [Bundler](http://bundler.io). If not, install the latest Sass pre-release: `gem install sass --pre`. These demo's will only work in Sass 3.3+.

To watch for updates, run `sass --watch stylesheets:stylesheets` while in the project root folder (if you're using Bundler, prepend with `bundle exec`, you know the drill). Please note that some files can take a while to compile (the svg example may take over 30 seconds).
